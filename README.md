# Overview

This software as an AI model was meant to track the difference between scenes in nature and in the house. For the first part of this my goal was for this to eventually realize the difference between the bathroom and the kitchen.

My purpose for creating this is to progress the big project of my robot. This is a good step in the right direction of later identifying A) where it is and B) where it needs to go.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Visual Studio Code, , and the Linux OS.

The programming language I used for this was Java for the methods used to connect the bluetooth in Android Studio. Python was used as the server to recieve commands.
